            "list_item_3": "Themes: The YoRHa project explores themes of identity, purpose, the nature of humanity, and the ethics of war. The androids struggle with their programmed objectives versus their emerging sense of self.",
            "list_item_4": "Tragedy: The YoRHa project is ultimately revealed to be a cycle of manipulation and planned obsolescence. The entire project, including the Council of Humanity, is a lie designed to keep the androids fighting and to eventually be destroyed to make way for a new generation of YoRHa units. This is a major plot point in NieR:Automata. In summary, YoRHa is a crucial element in the world of NieR, representing a complex and tragic attempt to reclaim Earth, while simultaneously questioning the very definition of what it means to be human (or android)."
